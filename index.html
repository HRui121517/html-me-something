				My name is Rui Huang(In my mother tongue, it is spelled <i>Ru&igrave; Hu&aacute;ng</i>, where <i>Ru&igrave;</i> is pronounced like 'Ray'). This is the story of how I found my passion in web developement.

		<h2>Section One</h2>
		<p>
			I was born in Tianjin, China. Growing up in the 90s, I had a happy childhood. I enjoyed reading and learning things at a young age(This is actually a photo of Shanghai, I couldn't find a good stock photo of Tianjin).

			<h2>Section Two</h2>
			<p>
				I went to Singapore on an exchange program at the age of 16. This was the first major decision I made for myself in my life. Having just graduated middle school, I was torn between attending high school in Tianjin or going to a completely new country to study in a different environment. I decided to take the risk and it was the best decision I ever made for my life. In Singapore, I became a fluent English speaker and developed a lot of friendship. I was a member of rock climbing club at my high school and we actually won the national champion in my senior year(admittedly there were only four teams, but it is an achievement nonetheless)!

		<h2>Section Three</h2>
		<p>
			After graduating from high school, I had to face the decision of where to attend college. Having returned back to China, my family moved to the capital of the city, Beijing. After this move, I realized just how diverse and modern this city is. I decided I want to go to a new country to study instead of returning back to Singapore. It is a nice country but too small(This is not Beijing either, there is no ocean in Beijing).

			<h2>Section Four</h2>
			<p>
				I started college at Maryville University in St. Louis in spring 2012. At the beginning, I was unsure of what I want to do so I applied for a general science degree. Being good at physics, naturally I wanted to do Engineering. I decided to do electrical engineering because I was very good at circuit analysis. During this time, I learned a coding class and I thought it is definitely not for me. Guess what, the teacher taught us C++. No wonder I thought like that!

			<h2>Section Five</h2>
			<p>
				After three and half years at Maryville, I transferred to Washington University in St. Louis to earn my degree in electrical engineering. It was hard work and I felt like maybe it is not the best choice for me. During this time, my favorite subject was digital logic and computer engineering related classes. I finally graduated from Washington University in May 2017 and by that time, I have decided to find a coding job. Thanks to Launchcode, I finally realized that web developement is my passion. Thank you Launchcode!
